## Introduction
Apache Kafka is an open-source event streaming platform used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. This guide will help you integrate Kafka into your project effectively.

## Prerequisites
Before you start with Kafka, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:
- Java 8 or later installed
- ZooKeeper installed (Kafka uses ZooKeeper for distributed coordination)

## Installation
1. Download Kafka from the [official website](https://kafka.apache.org/downloads).
2. Extract the downloaded archive to a directory of your choice.
3. Navigate to the Kafka directory in your terminal.

## Configuration
1. Kafka comes with default configuration files located in the `config/` directory.
2. You can modify the `server.properties` file to configure Kafka settings like port, log directories, and more.

## Usage
1. **Start ZooKeeper:**
   ```sh
   bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
   ```

2. **Start Kafka Broker:**
   ```sh
   bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
   ```

3. **Create a Topic:**
   ```sh
   bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic my-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 3 --replication-factor 1
   ```

4. **Publish Messages:**
   ```sh
   bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic my-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
   ```

5. **Consume Messages:**
   ```sh
   bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic my-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
   ```

## Examples
In the `examples/` directory of this repository, you can find code samples for producing and consuming messages using various programming languages and Kafka clients.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues, refer to the official [Kafka documentation](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/) or search for solutions on relevant forums.
